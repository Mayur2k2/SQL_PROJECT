In this project, we conducted a detailed analysis of pizza sales data using SQL. The dataset includes information about orders, customers, pizzas, and ingredients, providing a rich source of data to explore various business aspects. The primary goals were to identify top-selling pizzas, understand customer purchasing behavior, analyze peak sales times, and provide actionable insights for business improvement.
